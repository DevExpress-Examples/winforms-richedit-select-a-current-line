# How to select a current line in the RichEditControl


<p>This example illustrates the use of the <strong>StartOfLineCommand</strong> and <strong>EndOfLineCommand</strong> that allows you to determine start and end positions of the current line. It is important to distinguish <strong>line</strong> and <strong>paragraph</strong> terms because they are different in the context of the RichEditControl. <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument9556"><u>Paragraph</u></a> represents a single paragraph in a document. Paragraphs are delimited by the <strong>\r\n</strong> character pair. As for the line, it is a range of non-breakable text (i.e. a range of text that is not wrapped to the next row). There is no special API for lines and you should use the aforementioned commands to work with them.</p>
